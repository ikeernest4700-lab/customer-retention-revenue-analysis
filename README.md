## Business Problem
In the 2012–2015 e-commerce dataset for **Mr Fuzzy Teddy Bear Store**, significant drop-offs in the purchase funnel (especially Product Detail to Cart) and high customer churn were causing major revenue leakage.

The goal was to:
- Identify where users drop off in the funnel
- Segment performance by product, device, and campaign source
- Quantify the financial impact of conversion loss and churn

---

## Tools Used
- **SQL** : Data extraction, cleaning, joins, segmentation
- **Excel** :Basic data validation and inspection
- **Power BI** :KPI creation (DAX measures), funnel visualization, cohort analysis, interactive dashboards
- **Methods** : Funnel Analysis, Cohort Analysis, Segmentation, ROI Estimation

---
## Core Skills Applied
- SQL (Data cleaning, joins, segmentation, KPI preparation)
- Power BI (DAX measures, funnel analysis, cohort analysis, dashboards)
- Data Analytics (Funnel optimization, retention analysis, segmentation)
- Business Analysis (Revenue impact estimation, conversion optimization)

---

## Solution & Approach
- Built a **Funnel Optimization Dashboard** in Power BI covering:
  Landing → Product Detail → Cart → Shipping → Billing → Purchase
- Performed segmentation analysis by:
  - Product
  - Device type
  - Campaign source
- Extended analysis into **Cohort Retention Analysis** to evaluate churn and repeat purchase behavior

---

## SQL Data Preparation (Sample)

SQL was used to clean, transform, and structure data before loading into Power BI for analysis.

```sql

funnel as (
select 
distinct website_session_id,
max(case when pageview_url in ( '/home', '/lander-1','/lander-2','/lander-2','/lander-3','/lander-4','/lander-5')
then rn end) as landing,
max(case when pageview_url= '/products' then rn end) as product,
  max( case when  pageview_url IN (
            '/the-birthday-sugar-panda',
            '/the-forever-love-bear',
            '/the-hudson-river-mini-bear',
            '/the-original-mr-fuzzy') then rn end ) as product_detail,
max(case when pageview_url='/cart' then rn  end) as cart,
max(case when pageview_url ='/shipping' then rn end) as shipping,
max(case when pageview_url in ('/billing', '/billing-2') then rn end) as billing,
max(case when pageview_url ='/thank-you-for-your-order' then rn end) as purchase

from step 
group by 1
```

## Business Impact & Recommendations

A **10% improvement in Product → Cart conversion** could generate:
- **$581K additional revenue**
- **7,154 additional orders**

---

## Key Insights
- Major funnel leakage occurs at Product Detail → Cart stage
- Mr Fuzzy products and Google Search traffic are the highest-value drop-off points
- High churn indicates weak retention and engagement issues

---

## Recommendations
- Improve Product Detail UX (images, reviews, pricing clarity)
- Optimize Google Search landing experience through A/B testing
- Implement cart abandonment recovery strategies (email/SMS incentives)
- Develop retention strategies for high-churn cohorts

---

## Overall Business Impact
- **Project 1**: Landing page optimization → **$1.18M potential recovery**
- **Project 2**: Funnel + churn optimization → **$5.48M+ combined opportunity**

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw data using SQL, build KPI-driven dashboards in Power BI, and generate revenue-focused insights through funnel and cohort analysis.
